# portative-steptracker

The project is a simple and effective implementation of the step counter that we use in smart watches or smartphones. The data are entered from the keyboard and processed by the program. So we can get statistics for any selected month in terms of steps, kilometers walked and calories burned, as well as see the best strick of the month - the largest number of consecutive days in which the goal of steps was achieved.
